<p><strong>About Tamil Nadu</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> (&#8220;Tamil Country&#8221;), formerly Madras State, is one of the 29 states of India. Its capital and largest city is Chennai (formerly known as <a href="http://technoroads.com/">Madras</a>). Tamil Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the Indian subcontinent and is bordered by the union <a href="http://technoroads.com/about-us">territory </a>of Puducherry and the South Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. It is bounded by the Eastern Ghats on the north, by the Nilgiri Mountains, the Meghamalai Hills, and Kerala on the west, by the Bay of Bengal in the east, by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk <a href="https://technoroads.com/contact-php">Strait </a>on the southeast, and by the Indian Ocean on the south. The state shares a maritime border with the nation of Sri Lanka.</p>



<p>The region was ruled by several empires, including the&nbsp;three great
empires&nbsp;–&nbsp;Chola,&nbsp;Chera, and&nbsp;Pandyan&nbsp;empires, which
shape the region&#8217;s&nbsp;cuisine,&nbsp;culture, and&nbsp;architecture. The&nbsp;British
Colonial rule&nbsp;during the modern period led to the emergence of&nbsp;Chennai,
then known as Madras, as a world-class city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed
in 1956 after the&nbsp;reorganization of states&nbsp;on linguistic lines. The
state is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage
sites,&nbsp;hill stations&nbsp;and three&nbsp;World Heritage sites. </p>

<p><strong>About Tuticorin: </strong></p>



<p><a href="http://technoroads.com/">Thoothukudi </a>is a port town situated in the <a href="http://technoroads.com/contact">Gulf
</a>of Mannar about 125&nbsp;km North of Cape Commorin and its
environs form part of the <a href="http://technoroads.com/about-us">coastal
</a>belt which forms a continuous stretch of the flat country
relieved here and there by small rock out crops. The region, surrounding
Thoothukudi is liberally dotted with rain fed tanks. </p>



<p>Red soils found on the southern side of the Thoothukudi town
are composed quartz and variable quantities of fine red dry dust. The port is
an all weather one. The bay formed by the Hare Island, Devils point and the
main land gives ample protection to the lighters from monotonic weather. The
beach of Thoothukudi is featured with calm breeze and very low waves giving an
image of a big river.</p>
